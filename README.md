# BigQuery-Buffet
Often aspiring data engineers find it incredibly difficult to find the right sources, take up the right hands on challeneges to build skills necessary for the job. This is my attempt at learning to do various tasks with BigQuery, using python code and otherwise. 

1) Dumping data into BigQuery using Python : 
       This code creates a new dataset in an existing project and adds a table to it.
2) Querying an exisiting table using fastAPI
       This code accesses a Big Query dataset and generates the results using FastAPI.
       To run this code in a local and hit the local server. run the code on your respective command prompt "uvicorn python_file_name_withoutpy:app" then access the local host link https:localhost/8000(or any listening port you have set it to) If you wish to run it online IDE, like google collab, use ngrok for authentication and link of the host.
